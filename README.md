Just hold right click and release when it's where it should be.  
The item right to the tool get placed from the startpos to the wantedpos.

click RMB on a node, hold aux1 to invert pt  
hold RMB, hold aux1 for a 2d line, hold right and left for a straight line  
left click a node to change range, hold shift to change pt, additionally hold aux1 to invert pt  
release RMB to set nodes, hold up and down to abort if placing didn't succeed

The tool should not only place nodes in a line,  
it even uses the replacer or any tool in the next slot.  
I'm wondering, what happens if you have a linemaker tool in the next slot and another one in the third one?
