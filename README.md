Just hold right click and release when it's where it should be.  
The item right to the tool get placed from the startpos to the wantedpos.

The tool should not only place nodes in a line,  
it even uses the replacer or any tool in the next slot.  
I'm wondering, what happens if you have a linemaker tool in the next slot and another one in the third one?
